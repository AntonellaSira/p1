				<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Prepare the Blueberries
Rinse the blueberries and dry them thoroughly using paper towels. Any moisture will cause the chocolate to seize.</li>
					<li>Melt the Chocolate
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and coconut oil (if using).Microwave in 20-30 second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth and fully melted.
Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method).</li>
					<li>Using a fork or toothpick, dip each blueberry (or a small cluster) into the melted chocolate.
Let the excess chocolate drip off and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
					<li>Before the chocolate sets, sprinkle lightly with sea salt, crushed nuts, or drizzle with white chocolate for decoration.</li>
					<li>Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 15–30 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm.</li>
					<li>Enjoy immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3–4 days.</li>
